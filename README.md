# GSoC 2026 Preparation: A Journey Towards Open Source Contribution

This repository serves as a living portfolio of my dedicated preparation for Google Summer of Code 2026. My primary focus is on developing the skills and community standing necessary to contribute to a project under the **NumFOCUS** umbrella, with a particular interest in organizations like **Project Mesa**.

This is not just a collection of code; it is a transparent and structured log of my progress, demonstrating my commitment to professional software development practices and continuous learning.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Plan

My preparation is divided into distinct phases, following a strategic roadmap designed to build a competitive and evidence-backed candidacy.

### Phase 1: The Professional Contributor's Foundation
* **Objective:** Achieve advanced proficiency in Python and the core data stack. Make professional development practices an ingrained habit.
* **Key Technologies:** Advanced Python, NumPy, Pandas, `pytest`, `black`, `ruff`, `pre-commit`, and advanced Git workflows (`git rebase`).
* **Deliverable:** A fully tested and professionally formatted data analysis project.

### Phase 2: High-Leverage Technology Sprints
* **Objective:** Gain deep, practical experience in the high-leverage technologies identified in the NumFOCUS and Project Mesa ecosystems.
* **Key Technologies:** Geospatial Analysis (`GeoPandas`, `Shapely`, `Rasterio`), Agent-Based Modeling (`Mesa`), and Scientific Visualization (`Matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
* **Deliverable:** A series of small, focused projects demonstrating mastery of each technology.

### Phase 3: Community Integration & Initial Contributions
* **Objective:** Transition from a learner to a known and trusted community member by making initial, high-quality contributions.
* **Activities:** Engaging on mailing lists/forums, reproducing bugs, improving documentation, and submitting a first "good first issue" pull request.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Methodology

This repository is a testament to my commitment to writing clean, maintainable, and robust code.

* **üß™ Testing:** All code is rigorously tested using `pytest`.
* **‚ú® Code Quality:** Code formatting and linting are automated using `ruff` and `black`.
* **ü§ñ Automation:** These checks are enforced automatically before every commit using `pre-commit` hooks.
* ** storico Version Control:** I adhere to best practices for version control, including crafting clean, descriptive commit messages and using workflows like `git rebase` to maintain a professional project history.

Thank you for visiting. I welcome any feedback or suggestions.
