# GSoC 2026 Preparation: A Journey Towards Open Source Contribution

This repository serves as a **living portfolio** of my preparation for **Google Summer of Code 2026**.

🎯 **Goal**: To become a competitive candidate for contributing to a project under the **NumFOCUS umbrella**, with a strong interest in organizations like **Project Mesa**.

This is more than just a code collection — it’s a transparent, structured log of my journey, showcasing my commitment to **professional software development practices** and **continuous learning**.
